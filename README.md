A very simple switch for sending midi messages over 5-pin din. 

To implement:
- digital pin 1 connected to DIN pin 5 through 220 ohm resistor
- DIN pin 2 connected to ground
- DIN pin 4 connected to +5V through 220 ohm resistor
- digital pin 2 connected to ground through switch

To add more switches and messages:


for ATmega328
